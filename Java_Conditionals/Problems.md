1. Write a program using ternary operator to check whether 27 is a multiple of 3 or not.

2. Write a program to input 2 integers and check whether both the numbers are 
multiples of 7 or not.

3. Write a program to pass 2 integer numbers as parameters. If either of the two numbers is 0, display invalid entry
and the program should end, if it is valid entry, divide the larger number with the smaller number and display
the result.

4. Write a program to input 3 unique integers and print the smallest among them.

5. Write a program to input the three angles of a triangle and check whether it forms a triangle or not, if it forms
a triangle, check whether it is an equilateral, isosceles or a scalene triangle.
(Hint: To form a triangle, the sum of the angles should be 180 degrees.
To form an equilateral triangle every angle should be equal.
To form an isosceles triangle any two angles should be equal.
To form a scalene triangle all three angles should be different from each other.)

6. Write a program to input the three sides of a triangle and check whether it forms a triangle or not, if it forms a
triangle, check whether it is an equilateral, isosceles or a scalene triangle. (Hint: To form a triangle, each side
should be less the sum of the other two sides.
To form an equilateral triangle every side should be equal.
To form an isosceles triangle any two sides should be equal.
To form a scalene triangle all three sides should be different from each other.)

7. Write a program to accept a mark obtained by a student in computer science and print the grades accordingly:
Marks Grade
Above 90 A
70 to 89 B
50 to 69 C
below 50 D

8. A cloth showroom has announced the following festival discounts on the purchase of items, based on the total
cost of the items purchased:
Total Cost Discount (in Percentage)
Less than 2000 5%
2001 to 5000 25%
5001 to 10000 35%
Above 10000 50%
Write a program to input the total cost and compute and display the amount to be paid by the customer after
availing the discount.

9. Write a program to input 2 integers and check whether both the numbers are multiples of 7 or not.

10. An electronics shop has announced the following seasonal discounts on the purchase of certain items.
Purchase Amount is Discount on Laptop Discount on desktop PC
0–2500 0.0% 5.0%
25001 – 57000 5.0% 7.5%
57001 – 100000 7.5% 10.0%
More than 100000 10.0% 15.0%
Write a program based on the above criteria, to input name, address, amount of purchase and the type of
purchase (L for Laptop and D for Desktop) by a customer. Compute and print the net amount to be paid by a
customer along with his name and address.
(Hint: discount = (discount rate/100) * amount of purchase
Net amount = amount of purchase – discount).
